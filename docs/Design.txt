Use "done" events as a golden source,  we don't remove orders from the order book even if the size on book is 0 after a match. For a few reasons
	- "open" numbers reported was initally wrong
	- calculations in error(floating point possibly) led to size on book being 0 when there is actually size remaining
	- better to use a single source

Because of the above:
	- Rather than focusing on if match events are FIFO time order piority, we just reduce the size in the book by the makers size in the book. 
	- Reason is because we shouldnt make the assumption that "done" will always follow a "match" (although data seems to suggest it always has otherwise)
	
Few ways to check for done that is filled and a limit order but was never on the book:
    - ignore it. this will not affect the books. An error would have been counted towards the open msg skipped
    sequence number
    - check if the match order had a better price than the done order, if it did it was never on the books, if it
    did not it should have been on the books and we can throw an error that it was not

Config will be dynamic with hot loading capabilites and stored in a config server during production situations
